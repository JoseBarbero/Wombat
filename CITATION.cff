  Background

  The rapid expansion of Whole-Genome Sequencing has
  revolutionized the fields of clinical and food
  microbiology. However, its implementation as a routine
  laboratory technique remains challenging due to the growth
  of data at a faster rate than can be effectively analyzed
  and critical gaps in bioinformatics knowledge.


  Results

  To address both issues, CamPype was developed as a new
  bioinformatics workflow for the genomics analysis of
  sequencing data of bacteria, especially Campylobacter,
  which is the main cause of gastroenteritis worldwide
  making a negative impact on the economy of the public
  health systems. CamPype allows fully customization of
  stages to run and tools to use, including read quality
  control filtering, read contamination, reads extension and
  assembly, bacterial typing, genome annotation, searching
  for antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes and
  plasmids, pangenome construction and identification of
  nucleotide variants. All results are processed and resumed
  in an interactive HTML report for best data visualization
  and interpretation.


  Conclusions

  The minimal user intervention of CamPype makes of this
  workflow an attractive resource for microbiology
  laboratories with no expertise in bioinformatics as a
  first line method for bacterial typing and epidemiological
  analyses, that would help to reduce the costs of disease
  outbreaks, or for comparative genomic analyses. CamPype is
  publicly available at
